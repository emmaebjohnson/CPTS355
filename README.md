Programming Language Design Class

**Instuctor**
Sakire Arslan Ay

**Overview**
This course provides an introduction to basic concepts in the design of programming languages. Students are expected to already be familiar with the C /C++ or Java programming languages. Examples of concepts will be presented using a variety of languages (Haskell,  Postscript, Java, and Python, for instance). At the end of the course students will be familiar with the concepts that are commonly available in widely used programming languages and have experience using them in several contexts.

**Learning Objectives**
This course will help students to achieve the following objectives.

  - Identify the major components of programming languages including control structures, names, types, objects, exceptions, etc.
  - Summarize the properties of different programming language paradigms such as imperative, functional, and object oriented languages.
  - Demonstrate skills in using several programming languages (Haskell, Python, Java).
  - Describe the rules and properties of specific language concepts such as, type checking, scoping, parameter passing, function closures, etc.
  - Describe and evaluate given Haskell and Python code examples
  - Evaluate Haskell, Python, C/C++, and Java code examples by applying different scoping and parameter passing rules.  
  - Evaluate Haskell and Python code examples that involve function closures. 
  - Explain the basic structure of a programming language interpreter and identify the major steps of interpretation. 
  - Implement the interpreter for a simplified PostScript language. 
  - Develop the skills necessary to learn new programming languages quickly.
